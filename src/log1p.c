 * log1p(x) = log(1+x).  The log1p function is designed to avoid the
 * significant loss of precision that arises from direct evaluation when x is
 * small.
 * 
 * For x small, we use the following approach.  Let y be the nearest float
 * to 1+x, then
 *
 *     1+x = y * (1 - (y-1-x)/y)
 *
 * so log(1+x) = log(y) + log(1-(y-1-x)/y).  Since (y-1-x)/y is tiny, the
 * second term is well approximated by (y-1-x)/y.  If abs(x) >=
 * DBL_EPSILON/2 or the rounding-mode is some form of round-to-nearest
 * then y-1-x will be exactly representable, and is computed exactly by
 * (y-1)-x.
 *
 * If abs(x) < DBL_EPSILON/2 and the rounding mode is not known to be
 * round-to-nearest then this method is slightly dangerous: 1+x could be
 * rounded up to 1+DBL_EPSILON instead of down to 1, and in that case
 * y-1-x will not be exactly representable any more and the result can be
 * off by many ulps.  But this is easily fixed: for a floating-point
 * number |x| < DBL_EPSILON/2., the closest floating-point number to
 * log(1+x) is exactly x.

*   NAME	
* 	log1p -- Return log(1 + x). (V1.0)
*
*   SYNOPSIS
*	double result = log1p(double x);
*	  D0		   D0
*	double log1p(double x);
*
*   FUNCTION
*	Compute log(1 + x). This function is designed to avoid the significant
*	loss of precision that arises from direct evaluation when x is small.
*	This implementation uses high-precision algorithms for maximum accuracy.
* 
*   INPUTS
*	x - Input value. Must be > -1 for valid result.
*	
*   RESULT
*	result - log(1 + x). Returns -Infinity if x is -1, returns x if x is
*	        Â±0, returns NaN if x < -1, returns +Infinity if x is +Infinity.
* 
*   EXAMPLE
*	double x = 0.001;
*	double result = log1p(x);  
*
*   NOTES
*	This function is C89 compliant and provides IEEE 754 accuracy.
*	More accurate than log(1 + x) for small x values.
* 
*   SEE ALSO
*	log(), expm1(), math.h
